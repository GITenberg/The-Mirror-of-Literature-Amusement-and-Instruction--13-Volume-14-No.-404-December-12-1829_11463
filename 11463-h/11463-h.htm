    </div>
    <p>
      In the present <i>almanack season</i>, as it is technically
      called, the above illustration of our pages may not be
      inappropriate or ill-timed, inasmuch as it represents the
      spot whence all English astronomers make their calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Observatory was built by Charles II., in the year
      1675&mdash;probably, observes a recent writer, "with no
      better motive than to imitate Louis XIV.," who had just
      completed the erection and endowment of an observatory at
      Paris. The English Observatory was fortunately placed under
      the direction of the celebrated Flamstead, whose name the
      hill, or site of the building, still retains. He was
      appointed astronomer-royal in 1676; but Charles (as in the
      case of the curious dial at Whitehall, described by us a few
      weeks since<a id="footnotetag1"
      name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>),
      neglected to complete what he had so well begun: and
      Flamstead entered upon the duties of his appointment with
      instruments principally provided <i>at his own expense</i>,
      and that of a zealous patron of science, James Moore. It
      should seem that this species of parsimony is hereditary in
      the English Government, for, upon the authority of the
      <i>Quarterly Review</i>, we learn that "within the wide range
      of the British Islands <i>there is only one observatory</i>
      (Greenwich), <i>and scarcely one supported by the
      Government</i>. We say scarcely one, because we believe that
      some of the instruments in the observatory at Greenwich were
      purchased out of the private funds of the Royal Society of
      London."<a id="footnotetag2"
      name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first stone of this Observatory was laid by Flamstead, on
      the 10th of August, 1675. It stands 160 feet above low-water
      mark, and principally consists of two separate buildings: the
      first contains three rooms on the ground-floor&mdash;viz. the
      transit-room, towards the east, the quadrant-room, towards
      the west, and the assistant's sitting and calculating-room,
      in the middle; above which is his bed-room, the latter being
      furnished with sliding shutters in the roof. In
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page402" name="page402"></a>[pg
      402]</span> the transit-room is an eight-feet
      transit-instrument, with an axis of three feet, resting on
      two piers of stone: this was made by Bird, but has been much
      improved by Dolland, Troughton, and others. Near it is a
      curious transit-clock, made by Graham, but greatly improved
      by Earnshaw, who so simplified the train as to exclude two or
      three wheels, and also added cross-braces to the
      gridiron-pendulum, by which an error of a second per day,
      arising from its sudden starts, was corrected. The
      quadrant-room has a stone pier in the middle, running north
      and south, having on its east face a mural-quadrant, of eight
      feet radius, made by Bird, in 1749, by which observations are
      made on the southern quarter of the meridian, through an
      opening in the roof three feet wide, produced by means of two
      sliding shutters; on its west face is another eight-feet
      mural quadrant, with an iron frame, and an arch of brass,
      made by Graham, in 1725: this is applied to the north quarter
      of the meridian. In the same apartment is the famous
      zenith-sector, twelve feet in length, with which Dr. Bradley,
      at Wanstead, and at Kew, made those observations which led to
      the discovery of the aberration and nutation: here also is
      Dr. Hooke's reflecting telescope, and three telescopes by
      Harrison. On the south side of this room is a small building,
      for observing the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites,
      occultations, &amp;c., with sliding shutters at the roof and
      sides, to view any portion of the hemisphere, from the prime
      verticle down to the southern horizon: this contains a
      forty-inch achromatic, by the inventor, Mr. John Dolland,
      with a triple object-glass, a most perfect instrument of its
      kind; and a five-feet achromatic, by John and Peter Dolland,
      his sons. Here, likewise, are a two-feet reflecting-telescope
      (the metals of which were ground by the Rev. Mr. Edwards),
      and a six-feet reflector, by Dr. Herschell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lower part of the house serves merely for a habitation;
      but above is a large octagonal room, which, being now seldom
      wanted for astronomical purposes, is used as a repository for
      such instruments as are too large to be generally employed in
      the apartments first described, or for old instruments, which
      modern improvements have superseded. Among the former is a
      most excellent ten-feet achromatic, by the present Mr.
      Dolland, and a six-feet reflector, by Short, with a clock to
      be used with them. In the latter class, besides many curious
      and original articles, which are deposited in boxes and
      cupboards, is the first transit instrument that was,
      probably, ever made, having the telescope near one end of the
      axis; and two long telescopes with square wooden tubes, of
      very ancient date. Here, likewise, is the library, which is
      stored with scarce and curious old astronomical works,
      including Dr. Halley's original observations, and Captain
      Cook's Journals. Good busts of Flamstead and Newton, on
      pedestals, ornament this apartment; and in one corner is a
      dark narrow staircase, leading to the leads above, whence the
      prospect is uncommonly grand; and to render the pleasure more
      complete, there is, in the western turret, a <i>camera
      obscura</i>, of unrivalled excellence, by which all the
      surrounding objects, both movable and immovable, are
      beautifully represented in their own natural colours, on a
      concave table of plaster of Paris, about three feet in
      diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the north side of the Observatory are two small buildings,
      covered with hemispherical sliding domes, in each of which is
      an equatorial sector, made by Sisson, and a clock, by Arnold,
      with a three-barred pendulum, which are seldom used but for
      observing comets. The celebrated <i>Dry-well</i>, which was
      made to observe the earth's annual parallax, and for seeing
      the stars in the day-time, is situated near the south-east
      corner of the garden, behind the Observatory, but has been
      arched over, the great improvements in telescopes having long
      rendered it unnecesary. It contains a stone staircase,
      winding from the top to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. John Flamstead, Dr. Halley, Dr. Bradley, Dr. Bliss,
      Dr. Nev. Maskelyne, and John Pond, Esq. have been the
      successive astronomers-royal since the foundation of this
      edifice.

      TWIN SISTERS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The most extraordinary instance of this kind on record is
      that of the united twins, born at Saxony, in Hungary, in
      1701; and publicly exhibited in many parts of Europe, among
      others in England, and living till 1723. They were joined at
      the back, below the loins, and had their faces and bodies
      placed half side-ways towards each other. They were not
      equally strong nor well made, and the most powerful, (for
      they had separate wills) dragged the other after her, when
      she wanted to go any where. At six years, one had
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page403" name="page403"></a>[pg
      403]</span> a paralytic affection of the left side, which
      left her much weaker than the other. There was a great
      difference in their functions and health. They had different
      temperaments; when one was asleep the other was often awake;
      one had a desire for food when the other had not, &amp;c.
      They had the small pox and measles at one and the same time,
      but other disorders separately. Judith was often convulsed,
      while Helen remained free from indisposition; one of them had
      a catarrh and a cholic, while the other was well. Their
      intellectual powers were different; they were brisk, merry,
      and well bred; they could read, write, and sing, very
      prettily; could speak several languages, as Hungarian,
      German, French, and English. They died together, and were
      buried in the Convent of the Nuns of St. Ursula, at
      Presburgh.

      GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The following explanation of a few of the terms employed to
      designate parts of Gothic architecture, may, perhaps, prove
      acceptable to some of your readers. Having felt the need of
      such assistance in the course of my own reading, &amp;c.
      &amp;c.&mdash;I extracted them from an expensive work on the
      subject, and have only to lament that my vocabulary should be
      so defective.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Buttresses</i>.&mdash;Projections between the windows and
      at the corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Corbel</i>.&mdash;An ornamental projection from the wall
      to support an arch, niche, beam, or other apparent weight. It
      is often a head or part of a figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bands</i>.&mdash;Either small strings around shafts, or
      horizontal lines of square, round, and other formed panels,
      used to ornament spires, towers, and similar works.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cornice</i>.&mdash;The tablet at the top of a wall,
      running under the battlement. It becomes a
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Basement</i> when at the bottom of it, and beneath this
      the wall is generally thicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Battlement</i>.&mdash;It may be indented or plain; sunk,
      panelled, or pierced.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Crockets</i>.&mdash;Small bunches of foliage, ornamenting
      canopies and pinnacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Canopies</i>.&mdash;Adorned drip-stones.&mdash;<i>Vide</i>
      Dripstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Crypts</i>.&mdash;Vaulted chapels under some large
      churches, and a few small ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Crisps</i>.&mdash;Small arches; sometimes
      <i>double-feathered</i>, and according to the number of them
      in immediate connexion; they are termed <i>tre</i>-foils,
      <i>quatre</i>-foils, <i>cinque</i>-foils, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dripstone</i>.&mdash;The tablet running round doors and
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Featherings</i> or <i>Foliations</i>.&mdash;Parts of
      tracery ornamented with small arches and points, are termed
      <i>Feathered</i>, or <i>Foliated</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Finials</i>.&mdash;Large crockets surmounting canopies and
      pinnacles. This term is frequently applied to the whole
      pinnacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Machicolations</i>.&mdash;Projecting battlements, with
      intervals for discharging missiles on the heads of
      assailants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mullions</i>.&mdash;By these, windows are divided into
      lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Parapet</i>.&mdash;When walls are crowned with a parapet,
      it is straight at the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pinnacle</i>.&mdash;A small spire, generally four-sided,
      and placed on the top of buttresses, &amp;c., both exterior
      and interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Piers</i>.&mdash;Spaces in the interior of a building
      between the arches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Rood Loft</i>.&mdash;In ancient churches, not collegiate,
      a screen between the nave and chancel was so called, which
      had on the top of it a large projection, whereon were placed
      certain images, especially those which composed the rood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Set-offs</i>.&mdash;The mouldings and slopes dividing
      buttresses into stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Spandrells</i>.&mdash;Spaces, either plain or
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page404" name="page404"></a>[pg
      404]</span> ornamented, between an arch and the square formed
      round it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Stoups</i>.&mdash;The basins in niches, which held holy
      water. Near the altar in old churches, or where the altar has
      been, is sometimes found another niche, distinguished from
      the <i>stoup</i>, by having in it at the bottom, a small
      aperture for carrying off the water; it is often double with
      a place for bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tabernacle-work</i>.&mdash;Ornamented open work over
      stalls; and generally any minute ornamental open-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tablets</i>.&mdash;Small projecting mouldings or strings,
      mostly horizontal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tracery</i>.&mdash;Ornaments of the division at the heads
      of windows. <i>Flowing</i>, when the lines branch out into
      flowers, leaves, arches, &amp;c. <i>Perpendicular</i>, when
      the mullions are continued through the straight lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Transoms</i>.&mdash;The horizontal divisions of windows
      and panelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Turrets</i>.&mdash;Towers of great height in proportion to
      their diameter are so called. Large towers have often turrets
      at their corners; often one larger than the other, containing
      a staircase; and sometimes they have only that one.

      <i>The Norman</i>&mdash;Commenced before the conquest, and

      characterized by semicircular, and sometimes pointed, arches,

      <i>Early English</i>.&mdash;This style lasted until the reign

      <i>Decorated English</i>&mdash;Lasted to the end of Edward
      III., A.D. 1377. It is characterized by large windows with
      pointed arches divided into many lights by mullions. The
      tracery of this style is in flowing lines, forming figures.
      It has many ornaments, light and delicately wrought.
    </p>

      <i>Perpendicular English</i>.&mdash;This last style employed
      latterly only in additions, was in use, though much debased,
      even as late as 1630-40. The latest whole building in it, is
      not later than Henry VIII. Its characteristics are the
      mullions of the windows, and ornamental panelings, run in
      perpendicular lines; and many buildings in this style are so
      crowded with ornament, that the beauty of the style is
      destroyed. The carvings of it are delicately executed.

      In the days of Caliph Haroun Alraschid, the neighbourhood of
      Bagdad was infested by a clan of banditti, known by the name
      of the "Ranger Band." Their rendezvous was known to be the
      forests and mountains; but their immediate retreat was a
      mystery time had not divulged.
    </p>
    <p>
      That they were valiant, the intrepidity with which they
      attacked in the glare of noonday would demonstrate; that they
      were numerous, the many robberies carried on in the different
      parts of the Caliph's dominions would indicate; and that they
      were bloody, their invariable practice of killing their
      victim before they plundered him would argue. They had sworn
      by their Prophet never to betray one another, and by the
      Angel of Death to shed their blood in each other's defence.
      No wonder, then, that they were so difficult to be captured;
      and when taken, no tortures or promises of reward could
      extract from them any information as to the retreat of their
      comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as Giafar, the Vizier, and favourite of the Caliph,
      was walking alone in a public garden of the city, a stranger
      appeared, who, after prostrating himself before the second
      man in the empire, addressed him in these words: "High and
      mighty Vizier of Alraschid, Lord of the realms of Alla upon
      earth, whose delegate and vicegerent he is, hear the humblest
      of the sons of men&mdash;Vizier, hear me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak, son," said the Vizier, "I am patient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," continued the stranger, "what I have to communicate,
      be pleased to transmit to our gracious and well-beloved
      Caliph."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me hear thy suit&mdash;it may be in my power to assist
      you," replied the Vizier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The beauteous Ada is in the clutches of ruffians," responded
      the stranger; "and"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the Vizier, "proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be brief, the forest bandit snatched her from my
      arms&mdash;we were betrothed. I have applied to a mighty
      enchanter, the Genius of the Dale, who tells me she is still
      living, and in the cavern of the bandit&mdash;that her beauty
      and innocence melted the hearts of robbers, and that were
      they not afraid of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page405"
      name="page405"></a>[pg 405]</span> their haunt being
      discovered, they would have restored her to liberty; but
      where that cavern is was beyond his power to tell. However,
      he has informed me how I may demand and obtain the assistance
      of a much more powerful enchanter than himself; but that
      genius being the help of Muloch, the Spirit of the Mountain,
      I need the aid of the Caliph himself. May it please the
      highness of mighty Giafar to bend before the majesty of the
      Sovereign of the East, and supplicate in behalf of thy
      servant Abad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How," said the Vizier, "can the Caliph be of service to
      thee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is requisite," replied the stranger, "that my hand be
      stained with the blood of the Caliph, before I summon this
      most mighty fiend!"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "How!" cried the astonished Vizier, "would'st thou shed the
      blood of our beloved master?&mdash;No, by Alla!"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me," rejoined the stranger, interrupting him, "and
      Heaven avert that any thought of harm against the father of
      his people should warm the breast of Abad; I wish only to
      anoint my finger with as much of his precious blood as would
      hide the point of the finest needle; and should this most
      inestimable favour be conferred upon me, I undertake, under
      pain of suffering all the tortures that human ingenuity can
      devise, or devilish vengeance inflict, to exterminate the
      hated race of banditti who now infest the forests of the
      East."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Son," said the aged Vizier, "I will plead thy cause; meet me
      here on the morrow, and in the mean time consider thy request
      as granted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, I take my leave; and may the Guardian of the Good
      shower down a thousand blessings on thy head!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Abad made a profound obeisance to the Vizier, and they
      separated: the latter to conduct the affairs of the state,
      and the former to toil through the more menial labours of the
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came; Abad was at the appointed spot before sunrise,
      and waited with impatience for the expected hour when the
      Vizier was to arrive. The Vizier was punctual; and with him,
      in a plain habit, was the Caliph himself, who underwent the
      operation of having blood drawn from him by the hand of Abad.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight, Abad, as he had been directed by the Genius of
      the Dale, went to the cave of the Spirit of the Mountain. He
      was alone! It was pitchy dark; the winds howled through the
      thick foliage of the forest; the owls shrieked, and the
      wolves bayed; the loneliness of the place was calculated to
      inspire terror! and the idea of meeting such a personage, at
      such an hour, did not contribute to the removal of that
      terror! He trembled most violently. At length, summoning up
      courage he entered the mystic cell, and commenced challenging
      the assistance of the Spirit of the Mountain in the following
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the name of the Genius of the Dale I conjure you! by our
      holy Prophet I command you! by the darkness of this murky
      night I entreat you! and by the blood of a Caliph, shed by
      this weak arm, I allure you, most potent Muloch, to appear!
      Muloch rise! help! appear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the monster appeared, in the form of a human
      being of gigantic stature and proportions, having a fierce
      aspect, large, dark, rolling eyes, bushy eyebrows, and a
      thick black beard&mdash;attired in the habit of a blacksmith!
      He bore a huge hammer in his right hand, and in his left he
      carried a pair of pincers, in which was grasped a piece of
      shapeless metal. His eyes flashed with indignation as he
      flourished the ponderous hammer over his head, as though it
      had been a small sword&mdash;when, striking the metal he held
      in the forceps, a round, well-formed shield fell from the
      stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mortal!" vociferated the enchanter, in a voice of thunder,
      "there is thy weapon and defence!"&mdash;flinging the weighty
      hammer on the ample shield, the collision of which produced a
      sound in unison with the deep bass of Muloch's voice; nor did
      the reverberation that succeeded cease to ring in the ears of
      Abad until several minutes after the spectre had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abad rejoiced when the fearful visit was over, and, well
      pleased with his success, was preparing to depart; but his
      joy was damped on finding the hammer so heavy that he could
      not, without difficulty, remove it from off the shield. He
      left it in the cave, and returned with the shield only,
      comforting himself that however he might be at a loss for a
      weapon, he had a shield that would render him invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
      His next care was to discover the retreat of the robbers,
      otherwise he was waging a war with shadows. After making
      every inquiry, and wandering in vain for several months in
      quest of them, he was not able to obtain a glimpse of the
      objects of his search. Still they seemed to possess ubiquity.
      Their depredations continued, murders multiplied, and their
      attacks became more open and formidable. Missions were sent
      daily to the royal city from the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page406" name="page406"></a>[pg
      406]</span> emirs and governors of provinces residing at a
      distance with the most lamentable accounts, and soldiers were
      dispatched in large bodies to scour the country, but all was
      of no avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abad had almost abandoned himself to despair, when, one
      lovely evening, as he wandered along the banks of the Tigris,
      he observed a boat, laden with armed men, sailing rapidly
      down the river. "These must be a party of the ranger band.
      Oh, Mahomet!" said he, prostrating himself on the earth, "be
      thou my guide!" At length the crew landed on the opposite
      shore, which was a continued series of crags, and fastening a
      chain attached to the boat to a staple driven into the rock,
      under the surface of the water, they suffered the vessel to
      float with the stream beneath the overhanging rocks, which
      afforded a convenient shelter and hiding place for it, as it
      was impossible for any one passing up or down the river to
      notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having landed, the party ascended the acclivity, when,
      suddenly halting and looking round, to ascertain that they
      were not observed, they removed a large rolling stone that
      blockaded the entrance, and went into what appeared a natural
      cavern, then closing the inlet. Not a vestige of them
      remained in sight, and nature seemed to reign alone amidst
      the sublimest of her works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope again glowed in the breast of Abad; he soon found means
      for crossing the stream, and marched boldly to the very
      entrance of the robber's cave, and with all his might
      attempted to roll the stone from its axis. But here he was
      again doomed to disappointment: without the possession of the
      talisman, kept by the captain of the band, he might as well
      have attempted to roll the mountain on which he stood into
      the water beneath, as to have shifted the massy portal: the
      strength of ten thousand men, could their united efforts have
      been made available at one and the same time, would not have
      been sufficient even to stir it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abad was returning, disappointed and murmuring at his fate,
      when he bethought himself of the hammer which Muloch, the
      Spirit of the Mountain, had promised should be of such
      powerful aid. He hastened to the place where he had left the
      large instrument, and the next day brought it to the robbers'
      cave. He was in the act of lifting the massive weight, to
      have shattered the adamantine stoppage, when he was surprised
      by a noise behind him. He looked, and saw the banditti
      trooping up the ravine: they were returning, on horseback,
      from an expedition of plunder, laden with conquest. Abad
      hastily, to avoid discovery, struck the large stone with the
      charmed hammer, when it receded from the blow and, admitting
      him into the cave, closed itself upon him. The bandit chief,
      on seeing a stranger enter, ordered his men to advance
      rapidly up the ravine, which leads from the waters of the
      Tigris to the very threshold of the cave, embosomed amidst
      gigantic and stately rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain in vain applied the magic talisman to the charmed
      stone; the more potent shield of Muloch was within. Enraged
      at being thus thwarted, he demanded admittance. Abad made no
      reply, but, raising the enchanted hammer against the
      ponderous bulwark with his whole strength (and he felt as
      though gifted with more than mortal strength), he, at one
      tremendous blow, dislodged the stone which had stood at the
      entrance of the cave, amidst the shock of tempests and the
      convulsions of nature, from the creation of the
      world&mdash;as hard as adamant, heavy as gold, and as round
      as the balls on the cupolas of Bagdad. The bulk rolled down
      the ravine, bearing with it trees and fragments of rock; men
      and horses, and all meaner obstructions, were crushed to
      atoms beneath its weight, as it thundered down the sloping
      track, and occasionally fell over the steep precipices, which
      only served to increase its velocity! nor did it stop in its
      headlong career until it had annihilated the whole of the
      ranger band, and disappeared amidst the boiling foam of the
      angry Tigris!
    </p>
    <p>
      Abad, wrapt in wonder, cast his eyes on the earth, to view
      the terrific instrument with which he had performed so
      wonderful an exploit; but, to add more to his astonishment,
      the hammer and shield had vanished!
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity, and the hope of meeting his betrothed, now led him
      to explore the winding recesses of the mystic cavern, which
      consisted of numerous archways&mdash;some artificial, others,
      the natural formation of subterranean rocks, leading to a
      large apartment, in which were deposited the spoils which a
      century of plunder had contributed to accumulate. Whilst
      feasting his eyes on the rich piles of jewellery, and
      reviewing the bags of gold which everywhere presented
      themselves, his eyes met the features of a female. He could
      not be mistaken&mdash;he looked again as she advanced nearer
      the light&mdash;it was the beauteous Ada, still young and
      lovely! Bagdad did not possess such a maiden,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page407" name="page407"></a>[pg
      407]</span> nor did poet ever paint a fairer form! Abad
      thought her nothing inferior to the Houris of Paradise. She
      fulfilled every expectation through a long and virtuous life,
      during which time they enjoyed the ill-gotten wealth of the
      ranger band; and, although the splendour of their living was
      exceeded only by that of the Caliph's, they were bountiful to
      their dependents: they built an asylum for the
      destitute&mdash;were universally beloved and
      respected&mdash;and their magnificence was only surpassed by
      their benevolence!

      The frequent mention of the Cochineal Insect and Plant in our
      pages will, probably, render the annexed cut of more than
      ordinary interest to our readers.<a id="footnotetag3"
      name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The plant on which the Cochineal Insect is found, is called
      the <i>Nopal</i>, a species of Opuntia, or Prickly Pear,
      which abounds on all the coasts of the Mediterranean; and is
      thus described by Mr. Thompson, in his work entitled,
      <i>Official Visit to Guatemala;</i> "The nopal is a plant
      consisting of little stems, but expanding itself into wide,
      thick leaves, more or less prickly according to its different
      kind: one or two of these leaves being set as one plant, at
      the distance of two or three feet square from each other, are
      inoculated with the cochineal, which, I scarcely need say, is
      an insect; it is the same as if you would take the blight off
      an apple or other common tree, and rub a small portion of it
      on another tree free from the contagion, when the consequence
      would be, that the tree so inoculated would become covered
      with the blight; a small quantity of the insects in question
      is sufficient for each plant, which in proportion as it
      increases its leaves, is sure to be covered with this costly
      parasite. When the plant is perfectly saturated, the
      cochineal is scraped off with great care. The plants are not
      very valuable for the first year, but they may be estimated
      as yielding after the second year, from a dollar and a half
      profit on each plant."
    </p>
    <p>
      The insect is famous for the fine scarlet dye which it
      communicates to wool and silk. The females yield the best
      colour, and are in number to the males as three hundred to
      one. Cochineal was at first supposed to be a grain, which
      name it retains by way of eminence among dyers, but
      naturalists soon discovered it to be an insect. Its present
      importance in dyeing is an excellent illustration of
      chemistry applied to the arts; for long after its
      introduction, it gave but a dull kind of <i>crimson</i>, till
      a chemist named Kuster, who settled at Bow, near London,
      about the middle of the sixteenth century, discovered the use
      of the solution of tin, and the means of preparing with it
      and cochineal, a durable and beautiful scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fine cochineal, which has been well dried and properly kept,
      ought to be of a grey colour inclining to purple. The grey is
      owing to a powder which covers it naturally, a part of which
      it still retains; the purple tinge proceeds from the colour
      extracted by the water in which it has been killed. Cochineal
      will keep a long time in a dry place. Hellot says, that he
      tried some one hundred and thirty years old, and found it
      produce the same effect as new.

    <h3>
      A PROVINCIAL REPUTATION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I once resided in a country town; I will not specify whether
      that town was Devizes or Doncaster, Beverley or Brighton: I
      think it highly reprehensible in a writer to be
      <i>personal</i>, and scarcely more venial do I consider the
      fault of him who presumes to be <i>local</i>. I will,
      however, state, that my residence lay among the manufacturing
      districts; but lest any of my readers should be misled by
      that avowal, I must inform them, that in my estimation
      <i>all</i> country towns, from the elegant Bath, down to the
      laborious Bristol, are (whatever their respective polite or
      mercantile inhabitants may say to the contrary), positively,
      comparatively, and superlatively, manufacturing towns!
    </p>
    <p>
      Club-rooms, ball-rooms, card-tables, and confectioners'
      shops, are the <i>factories;</i> and gossips, both male and
      female, are the <i>labouring classes</i>. Norwich boasts of
      the durability of her stuffs; the manufacturers I allude to
      weave a web more flimsy. The stuff of tomorrow will seldom be
      the same that is publicly worn to-day; and were it not for
      the zeal and assiduity of the labourers, we should want
      novelties to replace the stuff that is worn out hour by hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man or woman who ever ventures to deviate from the beaten
      track should ever live in a country town. The gossips all
      turn from the task of nibbling one another, and the character
      of the <i>lusus naturae</i> becomes public property. I am the
      mother of a family, and I am known to have written romances.
      My husband, in an evil hour, took a fancy to a house at a
      watering-place, which, by way of distinction, I shall
      designate by the appellation of <i>Pumpington Wells</i>:
      there we established ourselves in the year 1800.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>manufacturers</i> received us with a great show of
      civility, exhibiting to us the most recent stuff, and
      discussing the merits of the newest fabrications. We,
      however, were not used to trouble ourselves about matters
      that did not concern us, and we soon offended them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We turned a deaf ear to all evil communications. If we were
      told that Mr. A., "though fond of show, starved his
      servants," we replied, we did not wish to listen to the tale.
      If we heard that Mr. B. though uxorious in public, was known
      to beat his wife in private, we cared not for the matrimonial
      anecdote. When maiden ladies assured us that Mrs. C. cheated
      at cards, we smiled, for we had no <i>dealings</i> with her;
      and when we were told that Mrs. D. never paid her bills, we
      repeated not the account to the next person we met; for as we
      were not her creditors, her accounts concerned us not.
    </p>
    <p>
      We settled ourselves, much to our satisfaction, in our
      provincial abode: it was a watering-place, which my husband,
      as a bachelor, had frequented during its annual season.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a watering-place he knew it well. Such places are vastly
      entertaining to visiters, having no "local habitation," and
      no "name"&mdash;caring not for the politics of the place, and
      where, if any thing displeases them, they may pay for their
      lodgings, order post-horses, and never suffer their names to
      appear in the arrival book again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with those who <i>live</i> at watering-places, it is
      quite another affair. For the first six months we were deemed
      a great acquisition. There were two or three <i>sets</i> in
      Pumpington Wells&mdash;the good, the bad, and the
      indifferent. The bad left their cards, and asked us to
      dances, the week we arrived; the indifferent knocked at our
      door in the first month; and even before the end of the
      second, we were on the visiting lists of the good. We knew
      enough of society to be aware that it is impolitic to rush
      into the embraces of <i>all</i> the arms that are extended to
      receive strangers; but feeling no wish to affront any one in
      return for an intended civility, we gave card for card; and
      the doors of good, bad, and indifferent, received our names.
    </p>
    <p>
      All seemed to infer, that the amicable gauntlet, which had
      been thrown down, having been courteously taken up, the
      ungloved hands were forthwith to be grasped in token of good
      fellowship; we had left our <i>names</i> for them, and by the
      invitations that poured in upon us, they seemed to say with
      Juliet&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "And <i>for</i> thy <i>name</i>, which is no part of
          thee,
        </p>
        <p>
          Take all myself."
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      No man, not even a provincial, can visit every body; and it
      seems but fair, that if a selection is to be made, all should
      interchange the hospitalities of
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page410" name="page410"></a>[pg
      410]</span> life with those persons in whose society they
      feel the greatest enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a dinner, therefore, did we decline&mdash;many a route
      did we reject; my husband's popularity tottered, and the
      inviters, though they no longer dinned their dinners in our
      ears, and teazed us with their "teas," vowed secret
      vengeance, and muttered "curses, not loud, but deep."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have hinted that we had no scandalous capabilities; and
      though slander flashed around us, we seldom admitted morning
      visiters, and our street-door was a non-conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But our next door neighbours were maiden ladies, who <i>had

      had seen better days&mdash;by which, I mean the days of
      bloom, natural hair, partners, and the probability of
      husbands.

      Their vicinity to us was an infinite comfort to the town, for
      those who were unable to gain admittance at our door to
      disturb our business and desires,
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "For every man has business and desire,
        </p>
        <p>
          Such as they are,"
        </p>
      </div>

    <p>
      were certain of better success at our neighbours', where they
      at least could gain some information about us "from
      eye-witnesses who resided on the spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>My</i> sins were numbered, so were my new bonnets; and for
      a time my husband was pitied, because "he had an extravagant
      wife;" but when it was ascertained that his plate was
      handsome, his dinner satisfactory in its removes, and
      <i>comme il faut</i> in its courses, those whose feet had
      never been within our door, saw clearly "how it must all end,
      and really felt for our trades-people."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have acknowledged that I had written romances; the
      occupation was to me a source of amusement; and as I had been
      successful, my husband saw no reason why he should discourage
      me. A scribbling fool, <i>in</i> or <i>out</i> of petticoats,
      should be forbidden the use of pen, ink, and paper; but my
      husband had too much sense to heed the vulgar cry of "blue
      stocking." After a busy month passed in London, we saw my new
      novel sent forth to the public, and then returned to our
      mansion at Pumpington Wells.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we drove up to our door, our virgin neighbours gazed on
      us, if possible, with more than their former interest. They
      wiped their spectacles; with glances of commiseration they
      saw us alight, and with unwearied scrutiny they witnessed the
      removal of our luggage from the carriage. We went
      out&mdash;every body stared at us&mdash;the people we
      <i>did</i> know touched the hands we extended, and hastened
      on as if fearful of infection; the people we <i>did not</i>
      know whispered as they passed us, and looked back afterwards;
      the men servants seemed full of mysterious flurry when we
      left our cards at the doors of acquaintances, and the
      maid-servants peeped at us up the areas; the shopkeepers came
      from their counters to watch us down the streets&mdash;and
      all was whispering and wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not make it out; was it to see the authoress? No; I
      had been an authoress when they last saw me. Was it the
      brilliant success of my new work? It <i>could</i> be nothing
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      My husband met a maiden lady, and bowed to her; she passed on
      without deigning to notice him. I spoke to an insipid man who
      had always bored me with his unprofitable intimacy, and he
      looked another way! The next lady we noticed tossed her head,
      as if she longed to toss it <i>at</i> us; and the next man we
      met opened his eyes astonishingly wide, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are <i>you</i> here! Dear me! I was told you could not show
      your&mdash;I mean, did not mean to return!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was evidently some mystery, and we determined to wait
      patiently for its developement. "If," said I, "it bodes us
      <i>good</i>, time will unravel it." "And if," said my
      husband, "it bodes us evil, some d&mdash;d good-natured
      friend will tell us all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      We had friends at Pumpington Wells, and good ones too, but no
      friend enlightened us; that task devolved upon an
      acquaintance, a little slim elderly man, so frivolous and so
      garrulous, that he only wanted a turban, some rouge, and a
      red satin gown, to become the most perfect of old women.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head simultaneously as he shook our hands, and
      his little grey eyes twinkled with delight, while he
      professed to feel for us both the deepest commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are cut," said he; "its all up with you in Pumpington
      Wells."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray be explicit," said I faintly, and dreading some cruel
      calumny, or plot against my peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've done the most impolitic thing! the most
      hazardous"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!" said my husband, grasping his cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I lament it," said the little man, turning to me; "your book
      has done it for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of the reviews, and trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How <i>could</i> you," continued our tormentor,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page411" name="page411"></a>[pg
      411]</span> "how could you put the Pumpington Wells people in
      your novel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Pumpington Wells people!&mdash;Nonsense; there are good
      and bad people in my novel, and there are good and bad people
      in Pumpington Wells; but you flatter the good, if you think
      that when I dipped my pen in praise, I limited my sketches to
      the virtuous of this place; and what is worse, <i>you</i>
      libel the bad if you assert that my sketches of vice were
      meant personally to apply to the vicious who reside here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> libel&mdash;<i>I</i> assert!" said the old
      lady-like little man; "not <i>I</i>!&mdash;every body says
      so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may laugh," replied my mentor and tormentor combined,
      "but personality can be proved against you; and all the
      friends and relations of Mr. Flaw declare you meant the bad
      man of your book for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His friends and relations are too kind to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have an irregular character in your book, and Mrs.
      Blemish's extensive circle of intimates assert that nothing
      can be more pointed than your allusion to <i>her</i> conduct
      and <i>her</i> character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And pray what do these persons say about it themselves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are outrageous, and go about the town absolutely wild."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fitting the caps on themselves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little scarecrow shook his head once more; and declaring
      that we should see he had spoken too true, departed, and then
      lamented so fluently to every body the certainty of our being
      <i>cut</i>, that every body began to believe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have hinted that <i>my</i> bonnets and my husband's plate
      occasioned heartburnings: no&mdash;that is not a correct
      term, the <i>heart</i> has nothing to do with such
      exhalations&mdash;bile collects elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who had conspired to pull my husband from the throne of
      his popularity, because their parties excited in us no
      <i>party spirit</i>, and we abstained from hopping at their
      hops, found, to their consternation, that when the novelty of
      my <i>novel</i> misdemeanour was at an end, we went on as if
      nothing had occurred. However, they still possessed heaven's
      best gift, the use of their tongues, they said of us
      everything bad which they knew to be false, and which they
      wished to see realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their forlorn hope was our "extravagance." "Never mind," said
      one, "Christmas must come round, and <i>then</i> we shall
      see."
    </p>
    <p>
      When once the match of insinuation is applied to the train of
      rumoured difficulties, the suspicion that has been
      smouldering for awhile bounces at once into a <i>report</i>,
      and very shortly its echo is bounced in every parlour in a
      provincial town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long bills, that had been accustomed to wait for payment
      until Christmas, now lay on my table at midsummer; and
      tradesmen, who drove dennetts to cottages once every evening,
      sent short civil notes, regretting their utter inability to
      make up a sum of money by Saturday night, unless <i>I</i>
      favoured them, by the bearer, with the sum of ten pounds,
      "the amount of my little account."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dennett-driving drapers actually threatened to fail for the
      want of ten pounds!&mdash;pastry-cooks, who took their
      families regularly "to summer at the sea," assisted the
      <i>counter</i>-plot, and prematurely dunned my husband!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not always convenient to pay sums at midsummer, which
      we had been in the habit of paying at Christmas; if, however,
      a single applicant was refused, a new rumour of inability was
      started and hunted through the town before night. People
      walked by our house, looking up wistfully at the windows;
      others peeped down the area, to see what we had for dinner.
      One <i>gentleman</i> went to our butcher, to inquire how much
      we owed him; and one <i>lady</i> narrowly escaped a legal
      action, because when she saw a few pipkins lying on the
      counter of a crockery-ware man, directed to me, she
      incautiously said, in the hearing of one of my servants, "Are
      you paid for your pipkins?&mdash;ah, it's well if you ever
      get your money!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas came at last; bills were paid, and my husband did
      not owe a shilling in Pumpington Wells. Like the old ladies
      in the besieged city, the gossips looked at us, wondering
      when the havoc would begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ho who mounts the ladder of life, treading step by step upon
      the identical footings marked out, <i>may</i> live in a
      provincial town. When we want to drink spa waters, or vary
      the scene, we now visit watering-places; but rather than
      force me to live at one again, "stick me up," as <i>Andrew
      Fairservice</i> says, in <i>Rob Roy</i>, "as a regimental
      target for ball-practice." We have long ceased to live in
      Pumpington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleeting are the tints of the rainbow&mdash;perishable the
      leaf of the rose&mdash;variable the love of
      woman&mdash;uncertain the sunbeam of April; but naught on
      earth can be fleeting; so perishable, so variable, or so
      uncertain, as the popularity of a provincial reputation.

      THE JUVENILE KEEPSAKE,
    </h3>
    <p>
      Edited by Mr. Thomas Roscoe, and dedicated to Professor
      Wilson, is no less attractive than its "Juvenile" rivals.
      Indeed, a few of the tales take a higher range than either of
      theirs,&mdash;as the Children's Island, an interesting Story,
      from the French of Madame Genlis; the Ball Dress; the Snow
      Storm; and the Deserted Village. The Heir of Newton Buzzard,
      a Tale in four cantos, by the late Mrs. John Hunter, is
      perhaps one of the prettiest juvenile novelties of the
      season. It is divided into
      Infancy&mdash;Childhood&mdash;Boyhood&mdash;and
      Youth&mdash;all which contain much amusement and moral point
      without dulness. We have not room for an entire story, but
      select one of Miss Mitford's village portraits:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dash was as beautiful a dog as eyes could be set on; one of
      the large old English Spaniels which are now so rare, with a
      superb head, like those which you see in Spanish pictures,
      and such ears! they more than met over his pretty spotted
      nose; and when he lapped his milk, dipped into the pan at
      least two inches. His hair was long and shiny and wavy, not
      curly, partly of a rich dark liver colour, partly of a
      silvery white, and beautifully feathered about the thighs and
      legs. He was extremely lively and intelligent, and had a sort
      of circular motion, a way of flinging himself quite round on
      his hind feet, something after the fashion in which the
      French dancers twist themselves round on one leg, which not
      only showed unusual agility in a dog of his size, but gave
      token of the same spirit and animation which sparkled in his
      bright hazel eye. Anything of eagerness or impatience was
      sure to excite this motion, and George Dinely gravely assured
      his sisters, when they at length joined him in the hall, that
      Dash had flung himself round six and twenty times whilst
      waiting the conclusion of their quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Getting into the lawn and the open air did not tend to
      diminish Dash's glee or his capers, and the young party
      walked merrily on; George telling of school pranks and school
      misfortunes&mdash;the having lost or spoilt four hats since
      Easter, seemed rather to belong to the first class of
      adventures than the second&mdash;his sisters listening
      dutifully and wonderingly; and Dash, following his own
      devices, now turning up a mouse's nest from a water furrow in
      the park&mdash;now springing a covey of young partridges in a
      corn field&mdash;now plunging his whole hairy person in the
      brook; and now splashing Miss Helen from head to foot? by
      ungallantly jumping over her whilst crossing a stile, being
      thereunto prompted by a whistle from his young master, who
      had, with equal want of gallantry, leapt the stile first
      himself, and left his sisters to get over as they could;
      until at last the whole party, having passed the stile, and
      crossed the bridge, and turned the churchyard corner, found
      themselves in the shady recesses of the vicarage-lane, and in
      full view of the vine-covered cottage of Nurse Simmons."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our closing extract is from "Anecdotes of South African
      Baboons," by Thomas Pringle, Esq.:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the practice of these animals to descend from their
      rocky fastnesses in order to enjoy themselves on the banks of
      the mountain rivulets, and to feed on the nutritious bulbs
      which grow in the fertile valley ground. While thus occupied,
      they generally take care to be within reach of a steep crag,
      or precipice, to which they may fly for refuge on the
      appearance of an enemy; and one of their number is always
      placed as a sentinel on some large stone, or other prominent
      position, in order to give timely warning to the rest, of the
      approach of danger. It has frequently been my lot, when
      riding through the secluded valleys of that country, to come
      suddenly, on turning a corner of a wild glen, upon a troop of
      forty or fifty baboons thus quietly congregated. Instantly on
      my appearance, a loud cry of alarm being raised by the
      sentinel, the whole tribe would scamper off with
      precipitation; splashing through the stream, and then
      scrambling with most marvellous agility up the opposite
      cliffs, often several hundred feet in height, and where no
      other creature without wings, certainly, could attempt to
      follow them; the large males bringing up the rear-guard,
      ready to turn with fury upon the dogs, if any attempted to
      molest them; the females, with their young ones in their
      arms, or on their shoulders, clinging with arms clasped
      closely round the mothers' necks. And thus climbing, and
      chattering, and squalling, they would ascend the almost
      perpendicular crags, while I looked on and watched
      them&mdash;interested by the almost human affection which
      they evinced for their mates and their offspring; and
      sometimes not a little amused, also, by the angry
      vociferation with which the old ones would scold me when they
      had got fairly upon the rocks, and felt themselves secure
      from pursuit."

      In the manufacture of a razor, it proceeds through a dozen

      "Scissors, in like manner, are made by hand, and every pair
      passes through sixteen or seventeen hands, including fifty or
      sixty operations, before they are ready for sale. Common
      scissors are cast, and when riveted, are sold as low as 4s.
      6d. per gross! Small pocket knives, too, are cast, both in
      blades and handles, and sold at 6 s. per gross, or a
      halfpenny each! These low articles are exported in vast
      quantities in casks to all parts of the world.

      "Snuffers and trays are also articles of extensive
      production, and the latter are ornamented with landscapes,
      etched by a Sheffield artist, on a resinous varnish, and
      finished by being dipped in diluted nitric acid for a few
      seconds or minutes.
    </p>

      "Messrs. Rodgers also introduced me to an extensive range of
      workshops for the manufacture of plated and silver ware, in
      which are produced the most superb breakfast and dinner
      services. The method of making the silver plate here and at
      Birmingham merits special notice, because the ancient method
      was by dissolving mercury in nitrous acid, dipping the
      copper, and depending on the affinity of the metals, by which
      a very slight article was produced. But at Sheffield and
      Birmingham, all plate is now produced by rolling ingots of
      copper and silver together. About the eighth of an inch in
      thickness of silver is united by heat to an inch of copper in
      ingots about the size of a brick. It is then flattened by
      steel rollers worked by an eighty horse power. The greater
      malleability of the silver occasions it to spread equally
      with the copper into a sheet of any required thickness,
      according to the nature of the article for which it is
      wanted. I saw some pieces of plated metal, the eighth of an
      inch thick, rolled by hand into ten times their surface, the
      silver spreading equally; and I was told that the plating
      would be perfect if the rolling had reduced it to the
      thinness of silver paper! This mode of plating secures to
      modern plate a durability not possessed by any plate silvered
      by immersion. Hence plated goods are now sought all over the
      world, and, if fairly used, are nearly as durable as silver
      itself. Of this material, dinner and dessert services have
      been manufactured from 50 to 300 guineas, and breakfast sets
      from 10 to 200 guineas, as sold on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Sheffield are actually cast and finished, most, if not
      all, the parts of grates sold as their own make by the London
      furnishing ironmongers. Their names are placed on them, but,
      in truth, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page413"
      name="page413"></a>[pg 413]</span> they merely put the parts
      together. I saw in Messrs. Picklay's rooms superior castings
      for backs of grates, little inferior in delicacy to plaster
      of Paris; and for grates connected with one of these
      patterns, I was told 100 guineas each was lately paid by a
      northern squire. Grates with folding doors are made here as
      well as at Chesterfield. The doors are in half heights, so as
      to serve two purposes, and grates so supplied sell for about
      two guineas extra. Mr. Picklay has brought the kitchen range
      to great perfection. With one fire he roasts, boils with
      water and steam, and bakes. Economy and completeness were
      never more usefully combined; and a public establishment in
      Sheffield is fitted with one which has cooked a dinner
      complete for above three hundred persons. It cost nearly
      &pound;300, but such grates for small families may be had at
      ten guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mercantile part of the Sheffield trade is performed
      chiefly by travellers, but the principal shops in London deal
      directly with the manufacturers here. To humour public
      prejudice in regard to "<i>Town make</i>," as it is called,
      and to serve as an advertisement for various retailers in
      London and other large towns, their connexions in Sheffield
      keep steel brands, with which their names are placed on the
      articles, and they thereby pass with the public as the real
      manufacturers. I saw in different workshops, in Sheffield,
      the steel brands of our famous <i>town makers</i>, and the
      articles in wholesale quantities packing up to meet the
      demand in London for "<i>real town made</i>." This is a
      standing joke at the expense of cockney credulity among the
      Sheffield cutlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sheffield is noted for the manufacture of superior files;
      and many anecdotes are told of the artifices which have been
      made use of to aggrandize or to repudiate the celebrity of
      the marks of some well-known makers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Sheffield generally the workmen get from 20s. to 24s. per
      week. Dry grinders get &pound;2, and some &pound;5 or
      &pound;6, and these high wages are paid as an equivalent for
      the shortness of life. Many women are employed as filers,
      burnishers, polishers, finishers, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and they
      get from 6s. to 12s. per week.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very <i>fine</i> cutlery is manufactured by Mr. Crawshaw. I
      saw in his warehouse all those elegant patterns of pen-knives
      which, in the best shops of London, Bath, &amp;c. excite so
      much admiration. His lobster knives, with four or more
      blades, on slit springs, with pearl and tortoiseshell
      handles, are the most perfect productions of British
      manufacture. His pen-knives with rounded or beveled backs, to
      turn in the quill and shave the point, are simple and
      effective improvements. He showed me plain pocket-knives so
      highly finished, that the first cost is 38s., yet so
      deceptive is cutlery, that I might have preferred others
      which I saw at only 7s. or 8s. It is the same in regard to
      the scissors of Champion and Son,&mdash;articles at two or
      three guineas did not appear to my uninstructed eye worth
      more than others at a few shillings; yet in all these high
      priced articles, nearly the whole cost is in workmanship, and
      there are but few workmen who can produce them. At the same
      time, Mr. Crawshaw deals in pen-knives at 5s. per dozen, and
      Mr. Champion in scissors at 2s. or 3s. per dozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The novelties and curiosities in this way are extremely
      numerous, and the makers and inventers are as modest and
      communicative as they are original and ingenious. Thus a
      knife an inch long, weighing eight pennyweights six grains,
      containing seventy odd blades and instruments, cost &pound;30
      in making: scissors the eighth of an inch long, twenty-five
      of which weigh but a grain, sold at 3s. per pair: a knife,
      mounted in gold and pearl, containing thirty blades, is
      valued at &pound;30; pocket-knives with twenty-six parts are
      sold at six guineas; the very best two blades mounted with
      pearl and gold, made by Crawshaw, are in common sale at two
      guineas in Sheffield. Messrs. Champion are esteemed the best
      makers of scissors; and ladies' working scissors, in general
      commerce, are finished and mounted as high as five or ten
      guineas. The best pocket-knives are made by Crawshaw, and
      fetch, in mounting, from two to five guineas. He is also the
      general maker of what are called the 'best town made.' I may
      here add, that Messrs. Champion can make a single set of
      table knives and forks, the fair market price of which would
      be 100 guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mechanical ingenuity of Mr. Crawshaw has also been
      displayed in the construction of AN ORRERY consisting of at
      least 1,000 wheels, which, by a single winch, turns all the
      planets in their respective periods; and also the whole of
      the satellites, including those of Herschell. This orrery,
      perhaps the completest in the world, was made in all its
      details by this gentleman, and, in its wheel-work, is an
      astonishing production.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the wonders of Sheffield is its Grinding
      Establishments. To aid <span class="pagenum"><a id="page414"
      name="page414"></a>[pg 414]</span> the grinders, companies
      have erected very spacious buildings divided into small
      rooms, and provided the whole with steam engines. The rooms
      are then let out by the month to master grinders; and at
      properly adjusted grindstones in each room I saw every
      variety of grinding, sharpening, and polishing. The finest
      work is polished by hand, and in this slavery I saw the
      delicate hands of the superior sex solely employed. The
      payment is trifling; but I was told that the hand of woman is
      the softest, most pliable, and most accommodating tool which
      has yet been discovered for conferring the finest polish on
      the refractory substance of steel. Can we wonder at its
      effect in softening the ruggedness of the other sex, and how
      hard must be the heart of that man which does not yield to an
      influence which subdues even the hardness of steel.
    </p>

      "The manufacture of spectacles, telescopes, microscopes, etc.
      is carried on to a great extent in Sheffield. Above five
      gross per day are ground of convex and concave glasses in one
      shop. Concave basins cast in iron of the radii of curvature
      of proposed lenses are fixed in rows on a frame, and rubbed
      with water and emery. A concentric convex basin is then
      covered with round pieces of plate glass fixed with pitch;
      and the convex stir face, with its glass pieces, is then
      turned and <i>wabbled</i> in the concave basin by steam
      power. In this manner from six to twelve dozen glasses are
      ground at once by one basin working within the other on an
      eccentric axle which <i>wabbles</i> the inner basin while it
      is revolved. Of course, in time, i.e. in eight or ten hours,
      the glasses are so abraded, that the outside of one basin
      exactly fits the other, and the lenses between are of the
      true curvature. They are then knocked off the pitch; turned
      and worked on the other side, on the second day; cleaned with
      spirit of tar, rounded or clipt with blunt scissors, and
      fitted in spectacle frames or tubes. In Mr. Cutt's factory I
      saw twenty-six of these basins for spectacles, and about
      eighteen for telescopes and microscopes; several being at
      work."

      "The Sheffield trades require and promote the Fine Arts in
      many ways. Chantrey was a carver and gilder here, and many
      persons in Sheffield were his first patrons, when he began to
      model. He was a native of Norton, where his parents still
      reside, and his first youthful employment was that of
      bringing milk to the town on asses, as is the present custom.
      At present, Mr. Law is an exquisite modeller in wax; and
      there are some ladies who copy the best pictures with a
      degree of taste and perfection which is astonishing. I allude
      particularly to those of Miss Green, of Westville House, and
      Miss Sambourne, at Highfield Green. Then this district
      possesses a treasure in Mr. Cowen, of Rotherham, whose merit
      as a landscape painter, has recommended him to the zealous
      patronage of Earl Fitzwilliam and the Duke of Devonshire. I
      confess I have never seen more exquisitely finished and more
      poetical productions."

      Darnall, near Sheffield. Such was the tradition at his native
      place. He died at Darnall in 1700 and was buried in Sheffield
      church, where there was a brass plate to his memory. It is
      certain that a Walker, was one of the masks, and that this

will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
